# Angular4 - User Management with Angular CLI

This project was generated with Angular Cli with version 1.4.2.

Steps:
1.Open a command prompt

2.Type: `npm install'. This installs the node-module and typings dependencies

3.Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

This is the simple application to kickstart with Angular(4) Projects with proper folder structure (Typescript)

Here, I have covered the following features which are used in the application

-> Routing with Lazy Loader (SPA - Single Page Application)

-> Module

-> Component

-> Creted Shared Module For Reusing

-> Service (HTTP Module with Observables)

-> Pipe (For filtering)

-> Inferface (For Custome Type based on the Data's)

-> Subscribe (For HTTP Module - Observables)

-> Modal (@ng-bootstrap) with Boostrap 4

-> Dom Manipulation (Renderer2)

-> Angular Data Tables (Searching, Sorting, Pagination etc...)

-> Other angular methods like [(ngModel)], *ngFor, *ngIf & (click)
