# Angular4 - User Management with Angular CLI

This project was generated with Angular Cli with version 1.4.2.

This is the simple application to kickstart with Angular(2,4..) Projects with proper folder structure (Typescript)

Here, I have covered the following features which are used in the application

-> Routing (SPA - Single Page Application)

-> Module

-> Component

-> Creted Shared Module for reusing

-> Service (HTTP Module with Observables)

-> Pipe (For filtering)

-> Inferface (For Custome Type based on the Data's)

-> Subscribe (For HTTP Module - Observables)

-> Modal (@ng-bootstrap) with Boostrap 4

-> Dom Manipulation (Renderer2)

-> Angular Data Tables (Searching, Sorting, Pagination etc...)

-> Other angular methods like [(ngModel)], *ngFor, *ngIf & (click)


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
